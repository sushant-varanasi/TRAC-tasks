A pulsar is a highly magnetized rotating compact star (usually neutron stars but also white dwarfs) that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation out of its magnetic poles. Vela is the brightest pulsar (at radio frequencies) in the sky. Isolated pulsars are detected by taking the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of an observational time series and searching through the resulting power spectrum.

this is the formula for fft
{\displaystyle X_{k}=\sum _{n=0}^{N-1}x_{n}e^{-i2\pi kn/N}\qquad k=0,\ldots ,N-1,}{\displaystyle X_{k}=\sum _{n=0}^{N-1}x_{n}e^{-i2\pi kn/N}\qquad k=0,\ldots ,N-1,}
After taking absolute value and then squarings, its form becomes like normal distribution.
{\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}}}e^{-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {x-\mu }{\sigma }}\right)^{2}}}
