For the GW event classification using GNN task, my approach would be something like each event a graph (so every time in prediction, if a new event wants to be tested, the event needs to be inputted in a form of a graph.), features like frequencies(max freq in a given interval, min freq, mean), strain of waves data, etc being nodes, and some related features could be connected by edges, like all terms related to freq could be fully connected to each other.
